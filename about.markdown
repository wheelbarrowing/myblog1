I'm Mohit. I'm what you'd call an accidental entrepreneur, and one who's here purely as a product of this time in the evolution of this country and the world at large. So while that defines a large part of what I do, I'd like this set of notes to be about everything in my life - things that relate to my other interests as history, maps, cooking, cycling, and any other place where I get a chance to go deep and find a non-obvious truth about the world. The eventual joy and kick of my life is to find non-obvious truths, and bond with others who revel in this.

This is also my very first attempt at making a website. Thanks GPT. And thanks to these wonderful folks who build tools like this one.  You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
