I have discovered that I have a 9-12 week period of function. Every time this period ends, I am in a phase of soul-searching. There are two possible reasons I have for why this happens. 

First, I run out of steam. More than the physical labour of being a founder at the helm, I have discovered that the relentless context switching is a much harder test. Where, as an employee, I could speed up or slow down on a single path with some branches, as a founder I have to stay current on many branches of the company. When I am in the zone, it feels like a general at the head of the army. I'm able to command resources at will and see things far away. But when I am exhausted, it starts to feel like an Aladdin cartoon character dodging throwing knives. Every priority on the priority list feels like it's completed to 90% only. Team mates start getting blocked by my lack of high-conviction decision making. 

Second, my job changes. 9-12 weeks is a long period for a company as early as ours. Last year, we had a 45-day period within which we went from "how the hell will these units sell" to "we are going to run out of stock". This year has been similar. In these last 14 weeks, we have gone from "nothing's moving", to constantly asking "where is new stock". I have gone from sales and customer experience, to CM2, to strategic projects of a totally different nature. These aren't smooth transitions. After every such phase, I have a few days of soul searching, before I am able to identify the right area of focus. 

I suspect the 9-12 week period is often a coincidental period where both cycles come together. The job demands stepping up, and I have little mental energy to step up. I am in the middle of such a period. It looks like this: 
- I go to work and feel like I have been working on the same thing forever, but nothing is moving
- I am unable to break down big vague goals into solvable problems
- I come back from work feeling like I did everything to 90%, which might as well be zero

The reignition process has been quite straightforward. Take a few days off work (at what feels like the worst time), come back, and half the problems you thought critical have been solved.
