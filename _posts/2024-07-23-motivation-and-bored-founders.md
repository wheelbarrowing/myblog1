I have been unwell for the last 5 days. I have also been disengaged from work since after day 1 of the illness. I don't know if my illness is affecting my engagement, or if I'm disengaged beyond illness. 

Nothing I seem to do seems to either go to completion, or have a tangible impact on the business. It is starting to get to me. Recipe ratings haven't improved, Cooking numbers haven't gone up, urgency in the team hasn't picked up, people haven't stepped up. The mid-year cycle was a rude shock because it felt like we had only been lucky so far. 

What doesn't help - I am always wanting to do something about it, and stopping myself from doing something about it. Because the doing is the job of my team. My job is to hire the right team, and get them to see what is the thing to do. I also think it doesn't help that the job feels really daunting in all its small parts. I suspect here my mental fatigue is coming in. The typical way of solving for such corners is to drill down relentlessly and come to the solvable core of a hard problem unsolvable in its entirety. I am unable to do this drilldown of late. 

It's not like the sickness induced break helped either. I can't find peace of mind in not doing anything. It only feels like I lose my connection to work more and more. So while writing this post, I slowly started to get back to work. It felt nice. I think over the next few days I will have to see how I will start moving the big numbers.
