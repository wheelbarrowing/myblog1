Writing in Public

I used to write in public many years ago. Writing for public consumption brings out things in your personality that surprise you. For one, it makes you want to be interesting. Either you evolve enough to understand that you bring interesting to the table yourself. Or you are one of the many, who secretly feel that you aren't interesting. And thus writing spaces become places to edit and showcase parts of your personality that are interesting. 

In my phases of writing I have found myself to be more performant and less curious. It's also made me less happy in the past, compared to when I'm not writing. Starting this now is an attempt at finding out if I've become the first type of person in the above description, or the second. I hope it's the first. And if it's not, like many things on the internet, this instance too becomes a ghost. 

All the best to both of us - you the reader, and me the writer.
